tutorial for GitHub

<h1> Testing1 </h1>   

1. Cloned from GitHub into local repo win PhpStorm projects.
2. Created new branch called 'readme-edits1'
3. Made changes to readme file.
4. Seleted Commit Changes in VCS options to commit changes to local repo.  
    Confirmed that no changes were made in remote repo.
5. Selected Push in VCS options to push changes to remote.
6. Changes saved in remote repo (i.e. GitHub)?
    Confirmed, changes saved in GitHub, but as a separate branch.
    
End Testing1


<h1> Testing2 </h1>
Based on Testing1, need to figure out how to manage branches.

From readme-edits1 branch:
1. Added new branch 'Test2'.
2. Committed changes to local.
3. Switch to readme-edits1 branch.

From Test2 branch:
1. Was using Test2 branch.  Checked out readme-edits1 branch. Committed changes.
None of the changes in Test2 are showing in this branch.
2. Closed PhpStorm.  Check if lines 22 and 23 are here when reopened.
3. Reopened PhpStorm and lines 22 and 23 were saved.
4. Committed changes.

1. merged Test2 to readme-edits1 (used Commit File option)
2. Deleted Test 2 branch.
3. Checked out Master branch.
4. Merged readme-edits and added this section.
5. Committed changes.
